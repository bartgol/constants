        The ratio of the circumference of a circle to its diameter. Several other definitions
        also apply, all being equivalent. E.g., the ratio of a circle area to the square of
        its radius.

    - name: speed of light
      symbol: c
      value: 299792458
      units: m s^-1
      description: |
        The speed at which electromagnetic waves propagate in vacuum, commonly referred
        to as the speed of light in vacuum.
    - name: Boltzmann's constant
      symbol: k_b
      value: 1.3806485279e-23
      units: J K^-1
      description: |
        Boltzmann's constant, relating average kinetic energy of particles in a gas
        with the temperature of the gas.

  geophisics:
    - name: Earth's radius
      symbol: R
      value: 6371000
      units: m
      description: |
        The average radius of the Earth when considering its shape as a spheroid,
        calculated from measurements at various points of Earth's surface.
